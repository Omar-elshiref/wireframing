What is Wireframing?
    Wireframing is a fundamental step in designing websites or applications. Think of it as creating a blueprint or a skeletal framework. It outlines the basic structure, layout, and spatial arrangement of elements on a page. The focus is on functionality, navigation, and how content will be organized, rather than visual design details like colors, fonts, or specific images.

Importance in the Design Process
Wireframing is crucial for several reasons:

    Clarifying Ideas: It helps translate abstract concepts into a tangible visual form that everyone can understand.   
    Facilitating Communication: Wireframes serve as a clear communication tool among designers, developers, clients, and stakeholders, ensuring everyone is aligned on the project's structure and flow.   
    Identifying Usability Issues Early: By focusing on the user interface structure, it allows teams to spot potential navigation problems, layout issues, or interaction flaws early in the process, before significant time and resources are invested in detailed design or development.   
    Saving Time and Resources: Catching and fixing structural or usability problems at the wireframing stage is much quicker and less expensive than making changes later in the development cycle.
